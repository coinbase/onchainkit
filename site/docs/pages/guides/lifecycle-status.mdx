# Lifecycle Status

OnchainKit Lifecycle Status allows you to manage the state of APIs and onchain transactions seamlessly within components.

## How to listen to the Lifecycle Status

The Lifecycle Status is a TypeScript object that provides easy access to the `statusName` and `statusData` properties, 
allowing you to stay informed and responsive.

```tsx twoslash
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import { Transaction } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/transaction';
// ---cut-before---
import type { LifecycleStatus } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/transaction';

const handleOnStatus = useCallback((status: LifecycleStatus) => {
  console.log('LifecycleStatus', status);
}, []);

<Transaction onStatus={handleOnStatus}>
  // omitted component code for brevity
</Transaction>
```

## Lifecycle Status

The Lifecycle Status includes 3 states common to all components:

### `init`

The component is initialized and ready for use.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'init';
  statusData: null;
}
```

### `success`

The component has successfully completed its main action, such as `swap` or `transaction`.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
    // the data returned from the API or onchain operation
  };
}
```

### `error`

The component has encountered an issue while fetching API data, executing an onchain operation, 
or needs to display a visual message to the user.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'error';
  statusData: {
    code: string; // The error code representing the location of the error
    error: string; // The error message providing developer details
    message: string; // The error message providing user-facing details
  };
}
```

<br />

Each component brings its own unique experience, and we have explored both the swap and transaction processes.

## Lifecycle Status with [`<Swap />`](/swap/swap)

### `amountChange`

Any of the Swap Input fields have been updated.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'amountChange';
  statusData: {
    amountFrom: string;
    amountTo: string;
    tokenFrom?: Token;
    tokenTo?: Token;
    isMissingRequiredField: boolean;
  };
}
```

### `transactionPending`

The transaction has been submitted to the network but has not yet been confirmed to be included in a block. 
During this pending state, the transaction is waiting to be validated by the network's consensus mechanism.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'transactionPending';
  statusData: null;
}
```

### `transactionApproved`

The transaction has been verified to be valid and it has been included in a block
however the transaction is not yet finalized.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'transactionApproved';
  statusData: {
    transactionHash: Hex;
    transactionType: 'Batched' | 'ERC20' | 'Permit2' | 'Swap';
  };
}
```

### `success`

The transaction has been added to the blockchain and the transaction is considered final.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
    transactionReceipt: TransactionReceipt;
  };
}
```

## Lifecycle Status with [`<Transaction />`](/transaction/transaction)

### `transactionIdle`

The transaction component is waiting for the user to take action.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'transactionIdle';
  statusData: null;
}
```

### `transactionPending`

The transaction has been submitted to the network but has not yet been confirmed to be included in a block. 
During this pending state, the transaction is waiting to be validated by the network's consensus mechanism.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'transactionPending';
  statusData: null;
}
```

### `success`

The transaction has been added to the blockchain and the transaction is considered final.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
    transactionReceipts: TransactionReceipt[];
  };
}
```
