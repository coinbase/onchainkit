The `Pay` component provides a one-click checkout experience for onchain commerce. 

Our all-in-one solution simplifies payment processing for onchain developers, removing complex integrations, high fees, and onboarding friction. Whether you're selling digital goods, services, or in-game items, this tool is for you.

## Features
- **Plug-and-Play Integration:** Add our `Pay` button with just a few lines of code. No backend required.
- **Seamless Onboarding:** Support Passkey wallets to eliminate onboarding drop-offs.
- **Real-time Merchant Tooling:** Get instant payment tracking, analytics, and reporting.

## Quick start

Before using the `Pay` component, ensure you've completed the [Getting Started](/getting-started) steps.

If you're starting a new project, we recommend using [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to scaffold your project following our [Getting Started](/getting-started) steps.

If you're adding the component to an existing project, simply install OnchainKit (`npm install @coinbase/onchainkit@latest`). Wrap the `<OnchainKitProvider />` around your app following steps in [Getting Started](/getting-started).

## Import the component

```tsx twoslash
import { Pay, PayButton, PayStatus } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/pay';

<Pay productId='my-product-id' > 
  <PayButton coinbaseBranded/> // set coinbaseBranded for branding
  <PayStatus />
</Pay>
```

That's it! Starting selling onchain with just a few lines of code. 

## Programmatic charges
In the serverful approach, developers will create product metadata and charges on their backend through the Coinbase Commerce [CreateCharge](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/commerce-onchain/reference/creates-a-charge) endpoint.

### Example use cases
- **Demand-based pricing:** Allow users to select seats or ticket types for events, and dynamically calculate charges based on availability and demand.
- **Product bundles:** Provide users with the option to create custom product bundles, applying discounts or special pricing based on the selected items.
- **Freelance Services:** Allow clients to specify project details such as hours, deliverables, and deadlines, and generate charges based on these custom inputs.

### Create the charge in your backend

We expose a prop called `chargeId` which will take a callback that returns a charge ID. This developer-provided callback **MUST** return a valid chargeId, and is run on every click to the Pay button. 

The chargeId returned from the callback is then hydrated by our backend API, which will send the batched commerce request to the Smart Wallet.

```tsx twoslash
// @errors: 2339 2304 2322
const createCharge = async () => {
  // The merchant's backend API will use a Commerce API Key
  // Metadata will be input server-side
  const { chargeId } = await fetch('api.merchant.com/createCharge');
  return chargeId;
}

<Pay chargeHandler={createCharge} />
```
