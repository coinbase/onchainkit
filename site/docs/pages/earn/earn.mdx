# `<Earn />`

The `Earn` component provides a simple interface for earning interest on your crypto via Morpho vaults on Base.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `Earn` component, ensure you've completed the [Getting Started](/getting-started) steps.

### Starting a new project

If you're starting a new project, we recommend using `create onchain` to scaffold your project. 

```bash
npm create onchain@latest
```

### Adding to an existing project

If you're adding `Earn` to an existing project, simply install OnchainKit.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @coinbase/onchainkit
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @coinbase/onchainkit
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @coinbase/onchainkit
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @coinbase/onchainkit
```

:::

Wrap the `<OnchainKitProvider />` around your app, following the steps in [Getting Started](/getting-started#add-providers).

## Quickstart

To use `Earn`, you'll need to provide a `vaultAddress` prop. A vault address can be obtained from Morpho's [Vaults page](https://app.morpho.org/base/earn).

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors: 2307
import { Earn } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn'; // [!code focus]

<Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A" /> // [!code focus]
```

<EarnMain />

## Customization

### Custom components and layouts

`Earn` accepts a `children` prop that can be used to render `Earn` subcomponents or custom components. 

For instance, you can render the `EarnDeposit` component by itself within the `Earn` component, along with any other custom components you'd like to render.

```tsx twoslash
// @noErrors: 2307
import { Earn, EarnDeposit } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn';

<Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A">
  <div>Custom header</div>
  <EarnDeposit />
  <div>Custom footer</div>
</Earn>
```

<EarnDeposit />

For more granular control, you can also render lower level subcomponents within `EarnDeposit` and `EarnWithdraw`. These subcomponents accept `className` props to customize their styles.

```tsx twoslash
import { Earn, 
        EarnDeposit, 
        EarnDetails, 
        DepositBalance, 
        DepositAmountInput, 
        DepositButton } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn';

<Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A">
  <EarnDeposit>
    <EarnDetails />
    <DepositBalance />
    <DepositAmountInput className="border-2 border-green-400" />
    <DepositButton />
  </EarnDeposit>
</Earn>
```

<RearrangedEarnDeposit />

### Customizing styles

The `Earn` component is best styled via a [OnchainKit theme](/guides/themes#custom-theme). You can also override individual component styles using `className`.


## Advanced Usage
If you'd like to implement your own custom components, you can use `useEarnContext` within an `Earn` component to access context and build your own components.

You can find the full interface for `EarnContextType` on the [Types page](/earn/types#earncontexttype).

Below, we use `useEarnContext` to implement a custom deposit interface by using `useEarnContext` to access the `depositAmount` and `setDepositAmount` context values.

:::code-group

```tsx twoslash [index.tsx]
// @noErrors: 2307
import { Earn, useEarnContext } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn';
import { CustomDepositButtons } from './custom-deposit-buttons';

  <Earn vaultAddress="0x7BfA7C4f149E7415b73bdeDfe609237e29CBF34A">
      <CustomDepositButtons />
  </Earn>

```

```tsx twoslash [custom-deposit-buttons.tsx]
import {EarnDetails, 
        EarnDeposit, 
        useEarnContext, 
        DepositButton} from '@coinbase/onchainkit/earn';

const predefinedAmounts = ['0.1', '1', '10'];

function CustomDepositButtons() {
  const { depositAmount, setDepositAmount } = useEarnContext();

  return (
    <EarnDeposit>
      <EarnDetails />
      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-2">
        {predefinedAmounts.map((amount) => {
          const selected = amount === depositAmount;
          return (
            <button
              key={amount}
              type="button"
              onClick={() => setDepositAmount(amount)}
              className={`rounded-md px-4 py-2 
              ${selected ? 'bg-[var(--ock-bg-primary)] text-[var(--ock-text-inverse)]' 
              : 'bg-[var(--ock-bg-secondary)] text-[var(--ock-text-primary)]'}`}
            >
              {amount}
            </button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
      <DepositButton />
    </EarnDeposit>
  );
}
```

<PredefinedInputDeposit />

Taking advantage of the data and methods provided by `useEarnContext`, developers can implement fully custom deposit and withdraw interfaces, modifying everything from UI elements to input behavior.


## Components

The `Earn` component includes the following subcomponents:

- `<Earn />` - A fully built Withdraw and Deposit component. Also includes a `children` prop to render custom components and provides `useEarnContext` to access the context values.
- `<EarnProvider />` - A headless provider that provides the `useEarnContext` hook to the `Earn` component.
- `<EarnDeposit />` - A fully built deposit card.
- `<EarnWithdraw />` - A fully built withdraw card.
- `<EarnDetails />` - A component that displays the details of the vault.
- `<DepositAmountInput />` - A component that handles the deposit amount input.
- `<DepositBalance />` - A component that displays the balance underlying asset in the user's wallet.
- `<DepositButton />` - A component that triggers the deposit transaction.
- `<WithdrawAmountInput />` - A component that handles the withdraw amount input.
- `<WithdrawBalance />` - A component that displays how much the user can withdraw from a vault.
- `<WithdrawButton />` - A component that triggers the withdraw transaction.
- `<YieldDetails />` - A component that displays the yield details of the vault.
- `<VaultDetails />` - A component that displays the vault details.


## Hooks
