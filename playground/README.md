# Onchainkit Playground

Sandbox environment to stage new releases of OnchainKit on different popular web frameworks.

We plan to test on 3 frameworks:

1. NextJS (app router)
2. NextJS (pages router)
3. Vite

**For now, only #1 is fully functional.**

## Getting Started

Navigate to NextJS (app router) demo app

```bash
cd nextjs-app-router
```

Install dependencies and run app

```bash
bun build:prepare && bun build:link && bun dev
```
