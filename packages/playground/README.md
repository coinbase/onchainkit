This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server, run the following command:

```bash
bun dev:watch
```

This will start the Next.js dev server, watch for changes in the `src` directory, and rebuild the `@coinbase/onchainkit` package.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
