## Previews Not Rendering

**Issue:** The app embed does not appear when previewed.

<Frame>
<img
  alt="Manifest Embed Example"
  src="/images/minikit/example_embed.png"
  height="364"
/>
</Frame>

**Cause:** This is typically due to an incorrectly formatted or unreachable splashImageUrl in the farcaster.json manifest.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Correct Format">
```json
"splashImageUrl": "https://www.example.com/splash_image.png"
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Common Mistake">
```json
"splashImageUrl": "https://www.example.com//splash_image.png"
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Best Practices

<Check>
**URL Validation:** Ensure the url is correct without typos. Double slashes, like seen above, will break the mini app preview.
</Check>

<Check>
**Public Accessibility:** Ensure the image is hosted at a publicly accessible URL.
</Check>

<Check>
**Image Requirements:** Confirm that the image meets the requirements: 200x200 pixels, under 1MB, and in PNG or JPG format.
</Check>

### Preview Tool

To verify your embed, use the Farcaster Frame Developer Tool:

## Manifest Debugging (farcaster.json)

Ensure your domain's manifest at `/.well-known/farcaster.json` is properly configured.

### Example Manifest

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "BASE64_HEADER_STRING",
    "payload": "BASE64_PAYLOAD_STRING",
    "signature": "BASE64_SIGNATURE_STRING"
  },
  "frame": {
    "version": "next",
    "name": "MiniKit",
    "iconUrl": "https://example.com/icon.png",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://example.com/splash.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#000000",
    "homeUrl": "https://your-app.com"
  }
}
```

### Checklist

<Check>
The domain in the payload must match the domain serving the manifest.
</Check>

<Check>
Ensure all asset URLs (icon, splash) are reachable and correctly formatted.
</Check>

## Incorrect FID or Signature Errors

This is often caused by a farcaster.json file that was signed using the wrong wallet. The signing wallet must match the custody address associated with your Farcaster account.

**Issue:** You encounter errors related to an invalid FID or failed signature validation.

**Cause:** The signing wallet does not match the Farcaster custody wallet.

### Resolution

To sign with the correct identity, import your Farcaster custody key into an external wallet:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Farcaster Mobile App">
Navigate to the Farcaster mobile app on your device
</Step>

<Step title="Access Recovery Phrase">
Navigate to: `Settings → Advanced → Farcaster Recovery Phrase`
</Step>

<Step title="Copy Seed Phrase">
Copy the 24-word seed phrase
</Step>

<Step title="Import to Wallet">
Import the phrase into a compatible wallet (e.g., Coinbase Wallet Mobile App, MetaMask or Rabby)
</Step>

<Step title="Sign Manifest">
Use this wallet for signing the `accountAssociation` payload
</Step>
</Steps>

### Manifest Signing Utility

Run the following to initiate the manifest signing workflow:

```bash
npx create-onchain --manifest
```

This CLI will open the signing UI in your browser and update local .env values automatically.

<Info>
This is required for generating valid signed manifests that link your domain to your Farcaster identity.
