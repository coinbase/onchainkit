The [Coinbase Smart Wallet] is a great way to onboard new users to onchain apps, and offers a number of experiential improvements to existing crypto users as well. As we're in a period of adoption and transition, a pain point has developed where a user with both the Smart Wallet and a browser-extension EOA can't always select the wallet they want while connecting to an app.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to more easily improve that experience by using the [Wallet] component from [OnchainKit] to connect your users to your app.

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

- Create a connection experience using the `Wallet` component from [OnchainKit]
- Customize the `Wallet` component to allow your users to connect from a chosen list of wallets
- Give users the option to select the [Coinbase Smart Wallet] or EOA while connecting to your app with RainbowKit

## Prerequisites

### Be familiar with modern, frontend web development

In this tutorial, you'll be working with a React frontend built with [Next.js]. While you don't need to be an expert, we'll assume that you're comfortable with the basics.

### Possess a general understanding of the EVM and smart contract development

This tutorial assumes that you're reasonably comfortable writing basic smart contracts. If you're just getting started, jump over to our [Base Learn] guides and start learning!

### Understand providers and connectors

You'll need to be familiar with how to connect an onchain app to the blockchain with a provider. If you're not, start with the [Onchain App Development] section of [Base Learn], or at least complete the tutorial [Introduction to Providers].

### Coinbase Wallets

You need to have both the [Coinbase Wallet] and [Coinbase Smart Wallet] for this tutorial. You need to set up the [Coinbase Wallet] in advance, but you can create a smart wallet during the tutorial.

## The Default Experience

Begin by using the [Onchain App Template] to quickstart a new app. Click the green `Use this template` button, create a new repo, and clone it.

You'll need a [WalletConnect] id if you don't have one already. Obtain it, the duplicate `.env.local.example` and rename it `.env.local`. Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID` to your id.

Then install dependencies, and run the app.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

<Note>
To bring the world onchain, we'll need to speak in terms people are already comfortable with. Consider using `Log In` rather than `Connect Wallet`!
</Note>


The demo app contains sections showing a number of [OnchainKit] components, including the [Wallet]. Click `Log In` in your browser with the Coinbase wallet extension present, select `Coinbase Wallet`, and you'll get the expected experience for an EOA wallet user with the browser extension.

</Frame>

Next, open the app in a private browser window with extensions disabled, and try again. This time, you'll get the Smart Wallet experience. If you don't have one already, you can create one now. They're neat!

## Customizing the List of Wallets

You can customize the list of wallets with the [Wallet Aggregator].

### Setting Up the Wallet Aggregator

Open `src/app/page.tsx`. Here, you find the root page for the app. You can see the `<WalletWrapper />`, which is what you used to log in and out.

Open `src/components/WalletWrapper.tsx`, and `src/wagmi.ts`. Take a quick look at `WalletWrapper`. It's a robust implementation of several [OnchainKit] components that shows how you can create a login experience that works well for all types of users, and provides the `<Identity>` component once logged in.

You can customize this by making some changes to `wagmi.ts`.

Start with `wagmi.ts`. Update it import the [RainbowKit] connectors for the wallets you want to use (We just picked the ones at the end of the supported list. Do your homework on which wallets to support!):

```tsx
import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi';
import { baseSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains';
import {
  coinbaseWallet,
  metaMaskWallet,
  rainbowWallet,
  uniswapWallet,
  walletConnectWallet,
  xdefiWallet,
  zerionWallet,
} from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/wallets';
import { connectorsForWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
```

Then, update the `connectorsForWallets` to use the wallets you've selected in the groupings of your choice:

```tsx
const connectors = connectorsForWallets(
  [
    {
      groupName: 'Recommended Wallet',
      wallets: [coinbaseWallet],
    },
    {
      groupName: 'Other Wallets',
      wallets: [rainbowWallet, metaMaskWallet, walletConnectWallet],
    },
    {
      groupName: 'U Wallets',
      wallets: [uniswapWallet],
    },
    {
      groupName: 'X Wallets',
      wallets: [xdefiWallet],
    },
    {
      groupName: 'Z Wallets',
      wallets: [zerionWallet],
    },
  ],
  {
    appName: 'onchainkit',
    projectId,
  },
);
```

Try connecting again. You'll see your updated list with the wallets organized to your preference!

## Tuning the Coinbase Wallet Connection

<Danger>
If you've already connected with the site, the below won't work unless you clear site data! It will appear that the flag does nothing.

In Chrome: Developer Tools -> Application Tab -> Storage Tab -> Clear Site Data button
In Firefox: Developer Tools -> Storage -> Right-click each item -> Delete All
</Danger>


With RainbowKit, you can force the connector to use the smart wallet or EOA with:

```tsx
coinbaseWallet.preference = 'smartWalletOnly';
```

And:

```tsx
coinbaseWallet.preference = 'eoaOnly';
```

The default is:

```tsx
coinbaseWallet.preference = 'all';
```

Set this line at the root level of `wagmi.ts`, under the imports:

```tsx
import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi';
import { baseSepolia } from 'wagmi/chains';
import {
  coinbaseWallet,
  metaMaskWallet,
  rainbowWallet,
  walletConnectWallet,
} from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/wallets';
import { connectorsForWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

coinbaseWallet.preference = 'all';
```

The `all` setting exhibits the behavior you've observed before. If the EOA is present, it will be used. Otherwise, the Smart Wallet UI/UX will pop up.

You can use these settings to direct users of your app to your preferred use case, or tie it to a UI element to give them a choice.

<Note>
The Coinbase Smart Wallet will support user-selected choice of which wallet to use soon!
</Note>


## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to use [OnchainKit] to log your users into your onchain app. You've also learned how to customize the connection experience with [RainbowKit], enabling your users a broader choice of which wallet to use with your app and making sure all are able to enjoy it.
