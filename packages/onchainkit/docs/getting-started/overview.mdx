OnchainKit is a full-featured SDK for building onchain applications. If you're building a mini app, a browser-based onchain app, or a hybrid app, OnchainKit's suite of components and utilities will help you build quickly and easily.

Whether it's connecting wallets, sending transactions, configuring a mini app, and much more, OnchainKit has you covered.

## An all-in-one web app and mini app solution

OnchainKit helps you build traditional onchain web apps, mini apps, and hybrid apps (apps that work in Farcaster clients such as the Base app, as well as the browser).

If you're new to mini apps, they are supercharged web apps that get additional functionality such as automatic wallet connection, push notifications, and more. Check out the [Mini Apps documentation](/mini-apps/overview) for more information.

## Philosophy

OnchainKit aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit that combines powerful onchain features with developer-friendly design. It's built with the following principles in mind:

- **Ergonomic design:** Full-stack tools that make complex onchain interactions intuitive
- **Battle-tested patterns:** Industry best practices packaged into ready-to-use solutions
- **Purpose-built components:** Pre-built modules for common onchain workflows
- **Framework agnostic:** Compatible with any React framework
- **Supercharged by Base:** Deep integration with Base's protocol features and ecosystem
