Building a new app? The easiest way to get started is to use `npx create-onchain`, which sets up everything automatically for you.

After running `npx create-onchain` and following the prompts, you'll have a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with OnchainKit installed and ready to go.

## Bootstrapping a new project

### Mini app support

If you're building a mini app or hybrid app, you can use the `--mini` flag to bootstrap a project with mini app support.

```bash Terminal
npx create-onchain --mini
```

### Traditional onchain web app

If you don't want to use mini app features, simply omit the `--mini` flag. If you decide to add mini app features later, you can convert your project to a mini by making some small changes to your codebase.

```bash Terminal
npx create-onchain
```

## CLI settings

The CLI will ask you a few simple questions to help you get started.

These are:

- Your project's name
- Your [Coinbase Developer Platform Client API key](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/onchainkit) (optional)
- Whether you'd like to enable telemetry (optional)

After this, simply `cd` into your project folder and run `npm install` (or use your package manager of choice) to install the dependencies.

Finally, run `npm run dev` to start the project and get to building!
